**WELCOME TO BOT.PY BY REGALK13**

Welcome to this discord bot, which I wrote in python for a few weeks, my fault I did not publish all the updates, I will take it into account later, I hope you like it and can use it to create your own bots.

The bot is executed through launcher.py, also init.py has a special path for linux so you must change if you use windows, I don't know if mac OS needs this update. This project is just starting, so I want to make it grow, something I want to do is host it but I don't have the host's money, since the typical free host can't handle a bot as complete as this one, so if you want me and you can help me in my patreon would appreciate it, https://www.patreon.com/regalk13.

Thanks for reading this and see you soon in the new projects.

Update 0.0.32

Now you can use "Utils" for take a proof about the level ups, exp and messages that you need to archieve it.
